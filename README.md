# QG_bykillingwaves
This project contains a set of codes for QG simulations in which the triply periodic Boussinesq solver is used and wave modes are killed in each time step. Hence, it is not the most efficient QG solver.

Read the section "QG mode" in PSBS (Pseudo-Spectral Boussinesq Solver) user manual for more information.
